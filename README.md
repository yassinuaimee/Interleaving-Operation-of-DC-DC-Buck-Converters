# Interleaving-Operation-of-DC-DC-Buck-Converters

Developed and simulated 1, 2, and 3-phase interleaved Buck converters using PLECS software, optimizing for current ripple, THD, and
efficiency. Programmed control algorithms on a Texas Instruments DSP for real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations, verifying
system performance under various load conditions. Conducted experimental validation of the converters on a Power Electronics Teaching
Setup (PETS), analyzing real-world performance against simulated results.
